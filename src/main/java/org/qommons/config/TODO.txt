Things left to do on Qonfig:

When an add-on specifies no requirement, but it specifies only one inheritance with a requirement
	(or it specifies multiple inheritance, all of which extend one of their requirements),
	the add-on should inherit it instead of giving an error
Think of more constraints we're not yet enforcing
Add QonfigElement.getAttribute/getChildrenInRole methods that allow specification of the toolkit and qualified names
	In all interpreter configuration, use these methods instead of the unqualified ones
Better error reporting for document parsing, like toolkit parsing
Allow modifications for abstract element-defs in addition to add-ons
Comment everything
Write a wiki
Think about version control, interaction between toolkit and interpreter versions
